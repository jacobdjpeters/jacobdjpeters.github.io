excerpt: "We evaluated three alternative maple species for syrup production in south-central Appalachia and found that box elder delivered comparable sap volume and sugar concentrations to sugar maple. Our findings suggest diversifying beyond sugar maple could sustain the industry through climate uncertainty while opening economic opportunities in regions currently unable to support traditional maple syrup production."
