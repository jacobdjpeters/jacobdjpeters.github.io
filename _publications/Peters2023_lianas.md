excerpt: "We quantified for the first time how lianas reduce carbon sequestration in temperate Appalachian forests, finding that shade-intolerant trees without lianas capture CO2 20% faster. Our results suggest that strategically removing lianas from light-demanding species like tulip poplar could enhance both forest carbon storage and timber sustainability as a natural climate solution."
