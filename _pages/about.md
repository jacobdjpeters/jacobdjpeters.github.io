I'm Jacob. Currently I am a PhD candidate at the Forest School at the Yale School of the Environment working with professor of silviculture Dr. Mark Ashton and professor of meteorology Dr. Xuhui Lee. My dissertation research is centered around lianas (woody vines) and their distributions and impact on temperate forests. I enjoy studying forest phenomena at varying scales: from continental-scale species distribution modeling, to UAV (drone) remote sensing, to field work and experiments to corroborate my remote sensing work. Additionally, I am involved in guiding several other projects for our current and recently-graduated masters of forestry. These projects range from mapping and understanding biomass changes in forest fragments surrounding cocoa plantations in Ghana, understory regeneration in teak plantations in Ghana, Sal forest cover change in Bangladesh, the effect of fuel reduction treatments on wildfire severity in California, and street tree diversity in urban canopies of New England. 

My teaching is uniquely situated at an intersection of code-based environmental data science, remote sensing, geospatial solutions, silviculture and forest management, forest mensuration, and forest ecology. I have assisted with our Drone Seminar course and GIS accelerator courses at Yale, and have been the teaching fellow for our Research and Communication Seminar for Masters of Forestry students, Forest Dynamics, Observing Earth From Space (remote sensing), Silviculture.
