I'm Jacob. I am a PhD candidate at the Forest School at the Yale School of the Environment working with professor of silviculture Dr. Mark Ashton and professor of meteorology Dr. Xuhui Lee. My dissertation research is centered around lianas (woody vines) and their distributions and impact on temperate forests. In the broadest sense, my work aims to inform climate smart forestry and forest management in general. While working toward this goal, I enjoy studying forest phenomena at varying scales: from continental-scale species distribution modeling to UAV (drone) remote sensing and, most importantly, field work and experiments to corroborate findings. I am also involved in guiding several other projects for our current and recently-graduated masters of forestry and PhD students. These projects range from mapping and understanding biomass changes in forest fragments surrounding cocoa plantations in Ghana, understory regeneration in teak plantations in Ghana, Sal forest cover change in Bangladesh, the effect of fuel reduction treatments on wildfire severity in California, and street tree diversity in urban canopies of New England. 

My teaching focuses on forest management, mensuration, and silvilculture while leaning heavily on code-based environmental data science, remote sensing, geospatial solutions, and forest ecology principles. At Yale, I have served as the teaching fellow for Silviculture, Forest Dynamics, the Research and Communication Seminar for Masters of Forestry students, and Observing Earth From Space (remote sensing).
