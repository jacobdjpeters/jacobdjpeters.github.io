# Research Interests

My research interests revolve around using big data, traditional field
methods, and remote sensing to study a range of forest phenomena. I
currently study temperate liana (woody vine) ecology, impacts, and
distributions using field experiments as well as satellite and UAV
remote sensing. I am testing the effect of releasing temperate forests
from lianas, creating large scale species distribution models for lianas
using Google Earth Engine, and quantifying liana abundance from UAV
LiDAR and multispectral imagery using machine learning and artificial
intelligence. Additional interests include silviculture, agroforestry,
urban forestry, forest restoration, microclimates, and forest
regeneration.
