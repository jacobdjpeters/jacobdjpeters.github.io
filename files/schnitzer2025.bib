            Determining species' maximum sizes provides valuable insights into their ecology, natural history, and potential ecosystem contributions. Using both plot‐based and forest‐wide surveys on six continents, we document the largest “Champion” liana ever recorded (866 mm diameter) from an African forest, as well as continental Champions Lianas from around the world.},
