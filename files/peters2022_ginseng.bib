	abstract = {American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a globally desired medicinal plant that is becoming increasingly difficult to study due to harvest-induced rarity. Thus, this species' conservation could be greatly improved via species distribution models, making it a model organism for studying sampling bias. In an attempt to refine a state-derived distribution model for ginseng in Virginia, we conducted additional surveys in a biologically diverse yet under-sampled region of the state-the Cumberland Mountains-thereby increasing the number of documented ginseng occurrences in this region thirteen-fold (N1 = 16, N 2 = 214) . Our surveys resulted in the model predicting an increased probability of American ginseng occurrence not only statewide (µ 1 = 0.099, µ2 = 0.104) but particularly so in the Cumberland Mountains (µ1 = 0.170, µ2 = 0.278), highlighting a consistently overlooked hotspot for biodiversity in Southern Appalachia. We suggest that more geographically balanced surveys and reduced overrepresentation of heavily protected and managed areas such as National Parks-in addition to heeding local knowledge-can be an effective method of mitigating geographic bias in predictions from species distribution models.},
