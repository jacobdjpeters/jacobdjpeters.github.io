	abstract = {The 10/20/30 rule is a common rule of thumb for planting trees in urban areas, but its connection to ecological theory and traditional biodiversity is unclear. The rule states that no more than 10\%, 20\%, or 30\% of trees in a city should belong to the same species, genus, or family, respectively. We compared two accepted biological diversity metrics (Shannon diversity and taxonomic distance) with the logic of the 10/20/30 rule. We utilized tree planting data for New Haven, Connecticut, {USA} and evaluated these data at three municipal scales: city, neighborhood, and census block as well as 86 grids of increasing cell sizes (from 10 × 10 m to 11.5 × 11.5 km). To determine whether the 10/20/30 rule aligns with diversity metrics, we created a function that follows the logic of the rule and quantifies the relative pass or failure of a site. Our “rule index” was significantly correlated with the two diversity metrics irrespective of spatial scale, leading us to conclude that it is a useful guide for planting. We suggest that consideration of the 10/20/30 rule at smaller spatial scales such as census blocks in larger cities could yield benefits for both biodiversity and social equity.},
